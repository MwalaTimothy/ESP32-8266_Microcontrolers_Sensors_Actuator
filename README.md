# D1 Mini Projects with Environmental Shields 

This repository contains a collection of D1 Mini projects that utilize environmental shields, including temperature and humidity sensors, barometric pressure sensors, and more.

## Getting Started
To get started with these projects, you'll need a dualbase board or a triple adapter D1 Mini board,as well as one or more environmental shields. The code for each project is included in this repository, and you can upload it to your D1 Mini board using the Arduino IDE or another compatible programming environment.

## Hardware Requirements
- Dual base adapter
- ESP8266 D1-mini
- Environmental shield/sensor

## Software Requirements
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) for programming the ESP8266 D1-mini
- [ESP8266 library for Arduino](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino)
- [Adafruit BME280 library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BME280_Library)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Digital-Weather-Station.git`
2. Open the project in the Arduino IDE and upload the code to the ESP8266 D1-mini.
3. Connect the environmental shield to the ESP8266 D1-mini.
4. Power the ESP8266 D1-mini using a USB cable.
